The provided `git diff` shows an update to the `AiCodeReview.java` file. Here's a breakdown of the changes:

1. The prompt in the `ChatCompletionRequest` has been updated from:
   ```
   "你是一个高级编程架构师，精通各类场景方案、架构设计和编程语言，请您根据git diff记录，对代码做出评审。代码如下:"
   ```
   to:
   ```
   "你是一个中国国内高级编程架构师，精通各类场景方案、架构设计和编程语言，请您根据git diff记录，对代码做出评审。代码如下:"
   ```

2. The rest of the code remains unchanged.

### Review of Changes:

- **Content Update**: The prompt now specifies that the reviewer is a domestic Chinese senior programming architect rather than just a general high-level programming architect.
  
- **No Functional Change**: This change does not affect the functionality or behavior of the code. It is purely a textual modification.

### Considerations:

- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Ensure that the new description accurately reflects the intended role and capabilities of the reviewer. If the service is marketed internationally, it might be beneficial to maintain a more generic description unless there's a specific reason for emphasizing domestic expertise.

- **Consistency**: If this is part of a larger documentation or user interface update, ensure consistency across all related materials.

Overall, the change seems minor and likely intended for localization or marketing purposes. If there are no further requirements or issues, the code review passes with these updates.
